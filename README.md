# Node-ChatRoom
The goal of this project is to create a collaborative online chat room for multiple users, by learning new technologies like <b>node.js</b> (using packages like <b>socket.io</b> for managing websockets and <b>express</b> for deploying the server) and basic <b>HTML</b> and <b>javascript</b> (using <b>jQuery</b> library) for the client side.
<br/>
<br/>

## How to deply the server
For deploying the server, run <b>npm install</b> in the root folder, thus installing all necessary node packages.
<br/>Then, run <b>node chatRoom.js</b> to deploy the server.
<br/>

## Disclaimer
This is my first time doing anything that looks like web development, so I hold no responsabilities for bad usage or bad practises learnt by reading the code in this repository. That being said, you are 100% free to use it for whatever you need, and I encourage you to learn node.js as it is a growing technology, easy to learn and very powerful.
